Steps to Initiliaze a Git Repo or Link a local repo.

Pre-Requisites:  GitHub Account,Git Bash must be installed.

NOTE: YOu will be asked to complete verification of your GIthub Account & grant permissin to connect
if you are doing this process for the first time.
IT's Simple just follow verification steps.I've ignored that process here.

STEPS:->
1->Create a folder on your pc where you want to store the project.or open existing folder having project.

2->Open that project in VS Code.

3->In Vscode's Terminal Select Git bash as CLI tool & Initiliaze the project using following command:
git init

You will see this message:Initialized empty Git repository in path_here

4->After that Do whatever you want in that folder (Create new html project,etc)

5->If You've not created a repository on Github you can visit GITHUB.com & create a repository manually for this project.

6->Visit the Home Page of  repository you want to connect on Github.com.You might be asked to verify.

7->There's a green button named Code inside that repo.Click that & Copy the HTTPS URL of that repo.

8->Use this command in your VS code's Git bash terminal to connect to that repo

git remote add origin "Paste HTTPS path of repo copied from Github here"

9->after connecting you can check if you are connected or not by switching to main branch as:
Command-            git checkout main
you willl see the following message if connected successfully
Branch 'main' set up to track remote branch 'main' from 'origin'.

10->Generally we don't push out code to main branch directly.

11->TO create out own branch type
git branch branch_name

12->Then move to this branch using
git checkout branch_name
SUccess Message: Switched to branch 'branch_name'

13->Now you can successfully push you code to this branch using these Steps
git add.
git commit -m "MEssage"
git push origin branch_name

14->If you want to pull code from any branch type:
git pull origin branch_name

15->If you want to merge your branch to main branch or any branch
assuming you are currently on your branch( to check it-> git checkout branch_name)
git merge main //in case of main branch
git merge branch_name //in case of any branch
